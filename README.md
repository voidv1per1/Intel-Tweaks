Step	Action
1. Download / Clone	Either clone the repo with git clone https://github.com/voidv1per1/Intel-Tweaks.git or download the ZIP.
2. Unzip / Inspect	If you downloaded the ZIP (VOIDTOOLS.zip), unzip it. Examine file structure: look for executables, scripts, configuration files, documentation.
3. Read the README	The README.md usually has instructions: what the tool does, requirements (OS version, drivers etc.), prerequisites like admin rights. If no instructions are there, you’ll need to inspect what files do.
4. Check dependencies	It may require: specific Windows version, drivers, Intel software, etc. Make sure you have what’s needed.
5. Run / Install	If there are scripts or executables: run them with elevated privileges if needed (for system tweaks). Be careful: system tweaking tools can cause instabilities or require restore points.
6. Adjust settings	The “tweaks” probably allow you to adjust CPU/system parameters. Use them as per the defaults or your target (gaming / streaming / productivity). Test performance, stability.
7. Backup & rollback plan	Always good to have backups or system restore, so if a tweak causes issues you can revert.
